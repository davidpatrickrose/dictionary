# Indemnity

`noun` Third Party
`plural` Third Parties

### Definition

**Third party** refers to a person who is not part of the legal relationship that you are thinking about.

There are usually two parties to a contract - so the "third" party is how people describe someone who is involved with the contract without being a part of the legal relationship.

### Example 1

- Pat owns a shop that sells surf boards.  
- Alice is a surfboard shaper who supplies Pat with the surfboards to sell.  
- Henry runs a delivery service that transports the the surfboards from Alice to Pat.

In the contract where Pat buys surfboards from Alice, Henry is a third party, because he's not part of that sale contract.

The contract might need to mention Henry with something like "Alice promises to use the third party delivery service provided by Henry".

In the contract where Alice pays Henry to deliver the surfboards to Pat, Pat is the third party, because he's not involved in the delivery contract.

The contract between Alice and Henry might need to mention Pat by saying "Pat promises to contact the third party shop owner twenty minutes before the delivery is due to take place." 

### Example 2

- Dave owns a website that sells vintage tea pots.
- Meegan owns the web hosting service that Dave uses to run his website.
- Debbie buys a tea pot from Dave's site.

In the contract where Dave pays Meegan for using her web hosting service, Debbie is a third party because she's not involved in that contract.

In the contract Debbie pays Dave for a teapot, Meegan is a third party because she's not involved in that contract.
