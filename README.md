# LawPatch Dictionary

The purpose of the LawPatch dictionary is to help people understand legal concepts so that they can use the law as a tool.

Consequently:

- understanding is the top priority: if a person with a reading age of thirteen cannot understand, the entry has not done its job well enough;
- each entry should have at least two examples of the concept applied to real examples; and
- the explanations should be as cross-jurisdictional as possible.

Entries in the dictionary so far:

- [indemnity](https://github.com/lawpatch/dictionary/blob/master/indemnity.md);
- [intellectual property](https://github.com/lawpatch/dictionary/blob/master/intellectual_property.md); and
- [liability](https://github.com/lawpatch/dictionary/blob/master/liability.md).
