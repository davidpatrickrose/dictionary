# LawPatch Dictionary

The purpose of the LawPatch dictionary is to help people understand legal concepts so that they can use the law as a tool.

It's not useful yet - we're still thinking through the structure.  The only entry so far is "third party".

Design principles (so far):

- Understanding is the top priority: if a person with a reading age of thirteen cannot understand, the entry has not done its job well enough.
- Each entry should have at least two examples of the concept applied to real examples.
- The explanations should be as cross-jurisdictional as possible.

Entries in the dictionary so far:

- [indemnity](https://github.com/lawpatch/dictionary/blob/master/indemnity.md) (incomplete);
- [intellectual property](https://github.com/lawpatch/dictionary/blob/master/intellectual_property.md) (incomplete);
- [liability](https://github.com/lawpatch/dictionary/blob/master/liability.md) (incomplete); and
- [third party](https://github.com/lawpatch/dictionary/blob/master/third_party.md) (COMPLETE EXAMPLE).
